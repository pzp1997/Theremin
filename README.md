## Theremin
A theremin written in CoffeeScript

> "The theremin is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist (performer). It is named after the Westernized name of its Russian inventor, LÃ©on Theremin, who patented the device in 1928." - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theremin)

This project is an online theremin! It uses the [Web Audio API](http://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) to generate tones, and the [Gamepad API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html) with a [Make!Sense](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1978340629/makesense-a-universal-interface-for-learning) board and sensors. If you do not have a controller to use as a Gamepad, there is also support for a good old fashioned mouse and keyboard.

I hope you enjoy playing this instrument. If you have any improvements or suggestions, either fork this repo and send me a pull request or just [send me an email](mailto:pzpaul2002@yahoo.com).
